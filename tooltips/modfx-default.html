<h3>Default module style for blocks:</h3>
<p class="intro">Each block has the ability to set a default module style, using the same module suffixes that you would normally apply to individual modules.</p>
<p>This is a great time saver, as it means that you can mix and match the available module suffixes, decide on a combination that you like and apply it to all of the modules in any given block.</p>
