<h3>How the automatic backup works:</h3>
<p>If you have a copy of Morph installed, you can choose to have a backup automatically created for you. Backups are stored in sites assets folder, which is located in "<em>[site-root]/morph_assets</em>"</p>

<h3>Not sure which file to install?</h3>
<p>If you haven't downloaded Morph yet, you will need to login to the club downloads area and <a href="http://www.joomlajunkie.com/member/downloads/" title="login to the club downloads to get the latest versions">grab the latest version</a> of the Morph template.</p>
<p>The file is called <strong>morph_template_v0.09.zip</strong>, with <em>v0.09</em> referencing the version you have downloaded and will be installing.</p>
