<h3>Default Style for blocks:</h3>
<p class="intro">Morph's blocks are by default plain without much styling, so either brown or grey depending on the themelet. The module styles allow for each block to have a unique style set on them.</p>
<p>A block style will apply either a solid color to the block as well as style the common elements that will appear in each block, such as headings, buttons and inputs etc.</p>
<p>Note: The styles depend on the themelet that you are using, some will have block styles and other not. Each themelet is different and has different styles, so see the themelet guide for more details.</p>
