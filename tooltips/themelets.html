<h3>Getting started with themelets:</h3>
<p class="intro">Think of themelets as the visual layer of Morph and what people visiting your site will actually see. Built on top of Morphs powerful intelligent engines, themelets inherit all of the underlying awesomeness that is Morph. Not only are themelets quicker to develop, but because they all sit on top of the same framework, it means you always have the same great features close at hand.</p>

The core framework in the center is the first primary layer as explained above. Notice it is always the same "engine" so to speak, with multiple themelets.</p>

<p>Each themelet is a "child" of the master/parent framework, hence they are also known as child themes (becoming popular in wordpress)</p>

<p>Themelets are the second primary layer of Morph. The big difference between the two layers is that, where there is only ever one Morph framework, there are multiple themelets that can be installed at once.</p>

<p>Themelets are to Morph, what templates are to Joomla. Everyone installs the same Joomla but can install any number of templates.</p>

<p>Themelets are an installable extension for Morph and are easily installed using Morph's Configurator. [link to flickr image of themelets]</p>

<p>Themelets provide the character of a website, the colors and images that make it unique and set it apart from the crowd.</p>

<p>Each themelet is a different implementation of Morph's core settings with a unique design. This means themelets can look vastly different and even have completely different layouts.</p>



<p>If you see 2 websites using Morph and they look completely different, then you can be sure they have the same core, but the themelet or child theme that is currently active is what makes it look different.</p>

<h3>Where can you get themelets?</h3>

<p>The first and primary reason we built Morph is to allow us as a Joomla template provider, to release our awesome designs so much faster than ever before, true to the definition of a proper framework. This means our members will have far more design options available to them for their projects than ever before.</p>

<p>We have already started creating dozens of design concepts and you can decide which ones we implement for Morph first. So why not head over to our voting site [link to voting site] where you can cast your vote for your favorite themelet design concept.</p>

<p>If you dont like our designs, you can always build your own themelets with Morph, its not that hard if you are familiar with xhtml and css. We have done as much as we can to make this as easy as possible and will be providing solid documentation for developers to build themelets using Morph in the near future.</p>
