<h3>Block Wrapping Explained:</h3>
<p>The frontend of Morph is divided up into different blocks. Each "block" is a structural section (check the Help tab on the right to see a visual reference of these blocks) and has the option to enable an additional wrapping div around it.</p>

 <p>We have done this to give you maximum flexibility when constructing your sites layout. Each blockâ€™s main div will be the width that you have defined in the General Settings of Configurator and will automatically be centered.</p> 
 
 <p>In the scenario where you would like to break outside of the fixed width layout, you can enable a wrapping block which will wrap around the outside of the block.</p>
