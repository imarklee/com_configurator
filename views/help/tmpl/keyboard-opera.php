<h2>Configurator's Keyboard Shortcuts:</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, due to a bug, keyboard shortcuts are disabled in the Opera browser. They will be included once a workaround has been found,
	or when Opera fixes the bug which will allow standards based Javascript to work.</p>
<p>We really want you to feel the full power of Configurator for Morph, and for this we recommend a really great browser, Firefox.</p>
