			<h3>Getting started with Configurator &amp; Morph</h3>
			<p class="intro">It looks like this is the first time you are running Configurator, so we thought you’d like a couple of pointers on using the system. In case you don’t already know, Configurator is our Template Management System (T.M.S.) and is used to control most aspects of Morph.</p>
			<p><img src="../administrator/components/com_configurator/images/maskot-right.png" alt="maskot" border="0" align="right" style="margin:-20px -7px 0 15px" /> We have poured our hearts into both Morph &amp; Configuratort hope you enjoy using it as much as we did making it!</p>
			<p>Take a couple of minutes to go through the different help sections and once you feel ready to jump in, simply close this window and get started.</p>
			<p><strong>This help pane can be easily accessed at any time,</strong> either by clicking on the “Getting Started” button in the top shelf, or using on of the built in keyboard shortcuts (cmd + h).</p>
		</div>
		<div id="splashtab-fullscreen" class="splashtabs">
			<h3>Working in Fullscreen mode</h3>
			<p class="intro">We all know how having that extra bit of real estate can really help your productivity, so we decided to add a feature to Configurator to allow you to easily toggle between fullscreen mode and normal mode.</p>
			<h4>Clicking the fullscreen link in the top shelf:</h4>
			<p><img src="../administrator/components/com_configurator/images/splash-fullscreen-bg.png" alt="maskot" border="0" align="right" style="margin:-35px -7px 0 15px" />There are two ways that you can use this feature. The first is by using the "Fullscreen mode" link in the top shelf (see the pic below), which </p>
			<h4>Using the built in shortcuts:</h4>
			<p>The other (and easier) way is to use the built in keyboard shortcuts. If you are on a mac, simply pressing <strong>cmd + f</strong> to toggle between the two views. All other users (windows, linux, etc) can use <strong>ctrl + f</strong>.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="splashtab-updates" class="splashtabs">
			<h3>Automatic update notifications</h3>
			<p class="intro">One of the challenges when developing Configurator, was to make it super easy for our members to know when new versions are available. The result is our built in notification system.</p>
			<p><img src="../administrator/components/com_configurator/images/splash-updates-bg.png" alt="maskot" border="0" align="right" style="margin: -5px 0px 0 15px" /></p>
			<p>Simply keep an eye on the top shelf to be notified when new versions of Morph, Configurator or your current themelet are available.</p>
			<p>Column 1 (green) is your installed version, column 2 (red) is the latest available version and the tick or cross icon in column 3 (blue) indicates whether your installed version is up-to-date.</p>
			<p>If your installed version and the online version differ, the second version will be hyperlinked to the JoomlaJunkie downloads, allowing you to go and get the latest version.</p>
			<p>We are currently investing an option to allow you to automatically upgrade from within Configurator, but more on that later ;)</p>
		</div>
		<div id="splashtab-assets" class="splashtabs">
			<h3>Working with your sites assets</h3>
			<p class="intro">The terms "assets" refers to the digital media that is specific to your project, such as your sites custom backgrounds, logos and themelets, etc. The assets tab allows you to manage these without having to use an ftp client.</p>
			<p><img src="../administrator/components/com_configurator/images/splash-assets-bg.png" alt="maskot" border="0" align="right" style="margin: -20px 0px 0 15px" />The assets folder currently only consists of your custom backgrounds, logos and themelets. We plan on extending this to include various different types of backups as well as different graphic "packs".</p>
			<p>The reason why they are stored together is so that they can be stored outside your templates folder, allowing you to upgrade Morph without overriding your custom images, themelets, etc.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="splashtab-methods" class="splashtabs">
			<h3>Understanding Morphs methods of control</h3>
			<p class="intro">If you use the analogy of Morph as a sports car, the engine would be the core framework, the themelet would be the design/body of the car &amp; the dashboard would be Morph's Configurator.</p>
			<p>In order to have total control, even at high speeds, the driver has a wide variety of methods for controlling this powerful machine, to do exactly what is desired. A comprehensive dashboard as well as the various controls such as the steering, pedals, gears etc make up the various methods of control that are needed.</p>
			<p>Morph's other primary Method of Control is the FX Range, namely: PageFX, MenuFx, ModuleFX &amp; ContentFX. These are stemmed from Joomla's "suffix" feature. Which in its simplest form is a way of appending a custom class to a page, module or menu.</p>
			<p>Using a combination of different page or module suffixes, not only are you able to transform your sites layout on a page-by-page basis, but also mix &amp; match your own custom module styles.</p>
			<p>We highly recommend that you checkout the relevant quick start guides in order to get the most out of the FX Range of features.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="splashtab-guides" class="splashtabs">
			<h3>Quick start guides to get you going</h3>
			<p class="intro">The Quick Start Guides are the quickest way for you to take advantage of Morphs FX Range and are close at hand in Configurators top shelf.</p>
			<p><img src="../administrator/components/com_configurator/images/splash-guides-bg.png" alt="maskot" border="0" align="right" style="margin: 15px 0px 0 15px" /> The PageFX guide lists all the <strong>page suffixes</strong> that you can use to change your sites layouts on a page by page basis.</p>
			<p>The MenuFX guide lists the suffixes that are used to activate the various menu options built into Morph.</p>
			<p>The ModuleFX guide lists the various module heading, background &amp; icon styles that you have at your disposal.</p>
			<p>The Block &amp; Position Maps give you a visual representation of Morph's building blocks &amp; the various module positions that are available. </p>
		</div>
		<div id="splashtab-contextual" class="splashtabs">
			<h3>Inline contextual help is close at hand</h3>
			<p class="intro">We realize that when getting started with Morph &amp; Configurator &amp; some of the options may not make immediate sense, so we have added extensive contextual help to assist you every step of the way!</p>
			<p><img src="../administrator/components/com_configurator/images/splash-contextual-bg.png" alt="maskot" border="0" align="right" style="margin: -2px 0px 0 15px" />Every single option in Configurator has either an info or help icon next to it.</p>
			<p>The <strong>info icon</strong> indicates that there is a standard tooltip available. These are generally for options which are more common and easier to understand.</p>
			<p>The <strong>help icon</strong> indicates that there is an pop-up help page available. These are used when a simple info tooltip just isn't enough.</p>
			<p>Let us know using the feedback form if anything doesn't make sense.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="splashtab-shortcuts" class="splashtabs">
			<h3>Using the built in keyboard shortcuts</h3>
			<p class="intro">We all love keyboard shortcuts, as they often boost your productivity. With this in mind, we have added a number of different keyboard shortcuts to increase your productivity when using Configurator.</p>
			<p><img src="../administrator/components/com_configurator/images/splash-shortcuts-bg.png" alt="maskot" border="0" align="right" style="margin: 0px 0px 0 15px" /></p>

		<div id="splashtab-prefs" class="splashtabs">
			<h3>Setting your preferences</h3>
			<p class="intro">The preferences pane can either by accessed from the link in the top shelf, or using the built in keyboard shortcut.</p>
			<p><img src="../administrator/components/com_configurator/images/splash-feedback-bg.png" alt="maskot" border="0" align="right" style="margin: 15px 0px 0 15px" /></p>
			<p>The preferences pane can either by accessed from the link in the top shelf, or using the built in keyboard shortcut.</p>
			<p>Mac users can use <strong>cmd + p</strong>, whereas users on all other systems can use <strong>ctrl + p</strong>.</p>			
			<h4>Preferences options:</h4>
			<p>- Enable / disable keyboard shortcuts<br />
			   - Change the shelf position (top or bottom)<br />
			   - Re-activate tab intros<br />
			   - Disable updates notification<br />
			   - Enable / disable tips			
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="splashtab-feedback" class="splashtabs">
			<h3>Submitting a bug or suggestion</h3>
			<p class="intro">We believe that submitting a bug or sending a suggestion should be super easy and NOT take you away from the interface you are providing feedback on. </p>
			<p><img src="../administrator/components/com_configurator/images/splash-feedback-bg.png" alt="maskot" border="0" align="right" style="margin: -5px 0px 0 15px" /> With that in mind we have built a really easy way for you to submit a bug or suggestion.</p>
			<p>You can either click on the <strong>Submit Feedback</strong> link in the top shelf, or use the built in keyboard shortcut.</p>
			<p>Mac users can use <strong>cmd + e</strong>, whereas users on all other systems can use <strong>ctrl + e</strong>.</p>
			<p class="important">Due to the vast number of users, we are not able to reply to emails that are received through Configurator. If you requires a response, please use the forum instead.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="splashtab-docs" class="splashtabs">
			<h3>Extensive online documentation</h3>
			<p class="intro">We are working on extensive documentation and tutorials covering all aspects of both Morph &amp; Configurator. However...</p>
			<p><img src="../administrator/components/com_configurator/images/splash-docs-bg.png" alt="maskot" border="0" align="right" style="margin: 0px 0px 0 15px" /></p>
			<p>Due to the fact that both Morph &amp; Configurator are still in changing daily, we have decided rather focus on the inline documentation within Configurator.</p>
			<p>We will be launching the dedicated Morph documentation site once Morph &amp; Configurator reach a stable release.</p>
			<p>We will also be adding a video tutorials section to Configurator once the layout is complete.</p>
			<p>Please use the inline documentation until the new documentation site is ready.</p>
